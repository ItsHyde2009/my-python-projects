# myPyProjects
In this repository I'll be uploading any Python projects I make (can be big or small projects). Bear in mind that I'm still learning this language.
-AUTHOR NOTES-
路Any help about the projects posted here (tips and things of that kind) is welcome and really appreciated.
路The projects here will be completely made by myself, so this is not a cooperative repository where you can post projects of your own.
路You CAN use the code posted here.
路This repository may be active and innactive depending if I feel working on it or not. (I'm busy with daily things so, I might not always have free time for this repository).
